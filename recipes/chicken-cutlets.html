        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Though a chicken cutlet may be a chicken breast cut in half, this recipe shows how to make chicken cutlets with double the deliciousness. A jar of sun-dried tomatoes does double duty for this healthy dinner idea. The flavorful oil they're packed in is used to sauté the chicken, and the tomatoes go into the cream sauce.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound chicken cutlets</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, divided</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground pepper, divided</li>
            <li>½ cup slivered oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, plus 1 tablespoon oil from the jar</li>
            <li>½ cup finely chopped shallots</li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle chicken with 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Heat sun-dried tomato oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning once, until browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 165°F, about 6 minutes total. Transfer to a plate.</li>
            <li>Add sun-dried tomatoes and shallots to the pan. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Increase heat to high and add wine. Cook, scraping up any browned bits, until the liquid has mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and stir in cream, any accumulated juices from the chicken and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper; simmer for 2 minutes. Return the chicken to the pan and turn to coat with the sauce. Serve the chicken topped with the sauce and parsley.</li>
        </ol>
